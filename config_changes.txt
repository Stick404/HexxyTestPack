todo: collect more mobs to disallow from list
Bloodmagic:Common
setup well of suffering blacklist

todo: balance numbers?
curios:common:
Consider adding additional slots due to the large number of mods we have, especially additional head slots.


still considering:
M&A:server:
Set rtprange to the distance between boarders
Consider turning down the percentage of tasks you need to complete to tier up, to make it a bit easier to do.

railways:server
Consider setting realistictrains to true, in order to make running a train a bit more interesting. Note that this could just be annoying, so do consider it.

I do not see the config option: 
Sophisticatedbackpacks:server
Consider making backpacks with upgrades only work if worn, to make them more balanced.
